Cat Cafe Team

### Introduction
Project 7 is the final part of the Semester Project, due Wed 4/27 – worth 100 points with 5/10/20 point 
possible bonuses. This is the final delivery of your project code and support with recorded team 
demonstrations.

### The Semester Project
Create a non-trivial set of classes and services that make use of some of the design patterns we cover to provide a nice set of functionalities to an end-user; we like to see some UI design, business logic, and data handling (MVC?), but your project may vary per your proposed topic. You may use any languages, 
frameworks, libraries, or utilities for your project as long as the project demonstrates object-oriented design.
